## Introduction into Machine Learning and Deep Learning

![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

A series of interactive lab notebooks we prepared for the Introduction into Machine Learning and Deep Learning course. The content of the series is based on Python, IPython Notebook, and PyTorch.

This is currently work in progress so expect minor errors and some rough edges ;)
